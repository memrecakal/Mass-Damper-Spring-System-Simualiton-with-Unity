# Mass Damper Spring System Simualiton with Unity Engine
1 degree of freedom system simualton is moddeled using Unity Engine. Same system is also moddeled with MATLAB Simulink and results were compared. While it took a few seconds for MATLAB to solve the model, Unity Engine was able to run the simulation real-time over 10fps while recording screen with improved physics engine settings.
