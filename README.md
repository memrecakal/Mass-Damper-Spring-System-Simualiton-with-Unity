# Mass Damper Spring System Simulation with Unity Engine
One degree of freedom system simulation is modeled using Unity Engine. The same system is also modeled with MATLAB Simulink, and results were compared. While it took a few seconds for MATLAB to solve the model, Unity Engine was able to run the simulation in real-time over 10fps while recording screen with improved physics engine settings.
